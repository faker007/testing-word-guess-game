## Learning points

### Notes about PropTypes Testing

- There's no need for PropTypes if you're using `Typescript`
- use Typescript's `interface`

### What is a mock function

- Fake function that runs instead of a real function
  - Can run alternate code, or just act as a placeholder
- Jest replaces real function with mock

### Why Mock?

- Mock serve three purposes
- Keep real function from running
  - Prevent side-effects like network calls
- Spy on function to see when it's called
- Provide return values
  - Set up test conditions
